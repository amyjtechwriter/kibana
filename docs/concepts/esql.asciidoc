=== ES|QL

preview::[]

The Elasticsearch Query Language, ES|QL, has been created to make exploring your data faster and easier using the {kib} Discover application. ES|QL was designed to combine the 9 other languages that can be used in {es} (KQL, SQL, EQL, DSL Lucene, Painless, Canvas, Timelion, and Vega). From version 8.11.0 you can try this new language.

This new piped language allows you to chain together multiple commands to query your data. Based on the query, Lens suggestions in Discover create a visualization of the query results.

ES|QL comes with it's own dedicated {es} Query Engine for greater efficiency. This engine delivers new capabilities like lookup[insert link]. From one query, search, aggregate, calculate and perform data transformations. Write your query directly in Discover or use the ES|QL API.
