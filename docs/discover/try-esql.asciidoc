Let's say we want to find out what machine operating system users have and how much ram is on their machine.  

[NOTE]
====
{esql} keywords are not case sensitive. 
====

. Set the time range to **Last 7 days**.
. Expand image:images/expand-icon-2.png[An image of the expand icon] the query bar.
. Put each processing command on a new line for better readability.
. Copy the query below:
+
[source,esql]
----
from kibana_sample_data_logs 
| keep machine.os, machine.ram
----
+
. Click **Update**.

Let's add to our query to find out the geographical destination of the visits and limit the results. 

. Copy the query below:
+
[source,esql]
----
from kibana_sample_data_logs 
| keep machine.os, machine.ram, geo.dest
| limit 10
----
+
. Click **Update**.

Let's sort the data by machine ram and filter out the destination GB. 

. Copy the query below:
+
[source,esql]
----
from kibana_sample_data_logs 
| keep machine.os, machine.ram, geo.dest
| sort machine.ram desc
| where geo.dest != "GB"
| limit 10
----
+
. Click **Update**.

. Click **Save** to save the query and visualization to a dashboard. 

To make changes to the visualization you can use the visualization drop-down. To make changes to the colors used or the axes, or click the pencil icon. This opens an in-line editor where you can change the colors and axes of the visualization.
