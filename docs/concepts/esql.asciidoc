The Elasticsearch Query Language, {esql}, has been created to make exploring your data faster and easier using the **Discover** application. {esql} was designed to combine the 9 other languages that can be used in {es} (KQL, SQL, EQL, DSL Lucene, Painless, Canvas, Timelion, and Vega). From version 8.11 you can try this new feature, which is enabled by default.

This new piped language allows you to chain together multiple commands to query your data. Based on the query, Lens suggestions in Discover create a visualization of the query results.

{esql} comes with it's own dedicated {esql} Compute Engine for greater efficiency. From one query you can search, aggregate, calculate and perform data transformations without leaving **Discover**. Write your query directly in **Discover** or use the **Dev Tools** with the {ref}/esql-rest.html[ES|QL API]. 

{esql} also features in-app help, so you can get started faster and don't have to leave the application to check syntax.

[[esql-observability]]
==== {observability}

{esql} makes it much easier to analyze metrics, logs and traces from a single query. Find performance issues fast by defining fields on the fly, enriching data with lookups, and using simultaneous query processing. Combining {esql} with {ml} and AiOps can improve detection accuracy and use aggregated value thresholds.

[[esql-security]]
==== Security 

Use {esql} to retrieve important information for investigation by using lookups. Enrich data and create new fields on the go to gain valuable insight for faster decision-making and actions. For example, perform a lookup on an IP address to identify its geographical location, its association with known malicious entities, or whether it belongs to a known cloud service provider all from one search bar. {esql} ensures more accurate alerts by incorporating aggregated values in detection rules.

Full documentation for this language is available in the {es} documentation, refer to {ref}/esql.html[{esql}].

Alternatively, a short tutorial is available in the **Discover** section <<try-esql, Try ES|QL>>.
