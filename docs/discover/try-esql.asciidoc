When you develop your task content, use the following guidelines:
* Match your text to the UI.
* For clickable items, use *bold*.
* When you refer to a UI button, use `click`. For example, `Click *New*.`
* When you refer to a UI checkbox or path, use `select`. For example, `Select all index checkboxes` and `Select *Manage index* > *Add lifecycle policy*.`
* Avoid using `button` and similar words. For example, use `Click *Save*.` instead of `Click on the *Save* button.`
