== Try ES|QL

preview::[]

The Elasticsearch Query Language, ES|QL, has been created to make exploring your data faster and easier using the Discover application. 

in the tutorial below we use the kibana sample logs

[[esql-kibana-query-bar]]
=== The query bar

After switching to {esql} mode, the query bar shows a sample query. For example:

[source,esql]
----
from kibana_sample_data_logs | limit 10
----

Every query starts with a <<esql-commands,source command>>. In this query, the
source command is <<esql-from>>. `FROM` retrieves data from data streams, indices, or
aliases. In this example, the data is retrieved from `kibana_sample_data_logs`.

A source command can be followed by one or more <<esql-commands,processing
commands>>. In this query, the processing command is <<esql-limit>>. `LIMIT`
limits the number of rows that are retrieved.

TIP: Click the help icon (image:images/esql/esql-icon-help.svg[]) to open the
in-product reference documentation for all commands and functions.

To make it easier to write queries, auto-complete offers suggestions with
possible commands and functions:

[NOTE]
====
{esql} keywords are case-insensitive. The following query is identical to the
previous one:
[source,esql]
----
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs | LIMIT 10
----
====

[float]
==== Expand the query bar

For readability, you can put each processing command on a new line. The
following query is identical to the previous one:

[source,esql]
----
FROM kibana_sample_data_logs 
| LIMIT 10
----

When you develop your task content, use the following guidelines:
* Match your text to the UI.
* For clickable items, use *bold*.
* When you refer to a UI button, use `click`. For example, `Click *New*.`
* When you refer to a UI checkbox or path, use `select`. For example, `Select all index checkboxes` and `Select *Manage index* > *Add lifecycle policy*.`
* Avoid using `button` and similar words. For example, use `Click *Save*.` instead of `Click on the *Save* button.`
